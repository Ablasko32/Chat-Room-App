## **How to use**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repoUrl>
   ```

2. **Configure Redis**

   The application uses a Redis instance managed by Docker. Ensure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed.Then run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   > docker-desktop required on windows

3. **Generate SSL certificates**

   Generate SSL certificates for both the backend and frontend using tools like `openssl` or `makecert`. Save them with the following filenames:

   - `cert.pem` (SSL certificate)
   - `key.pem` (Private key)

   Place these files in the root directory of both the backend and frontend folders..

   > Encryption requires HTTPS!
   >
   > > If using openssl, ensure to manually trust both the backend and frontend.

4. **Configure .env and install dependencies:**

   - To configure your environment, create a .env file in the root directory of both backend and frontend and set the required variables like the `.env.example` files.

   - Install Dependencies via:

     ```bash
     npm i
     ```

5. **Start backend**

   Navigate to the backend directory and start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   > Basic API Docs available via Swagger on /backend/api-docs
